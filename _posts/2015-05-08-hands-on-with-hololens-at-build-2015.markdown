## Introduction
At the Build 2015 day 1 keynote, Alex Kipman ([@akipman](https://twitter.com/akipman)) announced that they had "hundreds" of HoloLens devices at the event and that attendees could register to have a chance to demo one.  As soon as the slide with the registration link went up, the event wifi and mobile carrier traffic exploded with people trying to register before their peers.  As you might have guessed from the title of this blog post, I was one of the lucky people who got an appointment.

## The Setup
The confirmation email told me to go to the Intercontinental Hotel (located next to the event).  When I got there, it quickly became evident that security was *very* important to Microsoft.  They put my group on the elevator (which was secured by guards) and radio'd the 27th floor that we were on our way.

After getting a HoloLens shirt (I live for free shirts so I was ecstatic about this) and a special badge, we were taken to a secure locker room and instructed to leave pretty much all of our personal belongings in a locker.  I took off my sweatshirt and loaded my phone, keys, wallet, and backpack in to the locker.  Next we got a brief introduction on how to do gestures and they measured the distance of our eyes (for calibrating the HoloLens).

## The Experience
The HoloLens actually fit over my head pretty comfortably.
