Hello, my name is Dean and I am a software engineer living in Portland, OR. I enjoy building quality software, photography, being a parent, traveling and writing/recording music. I am an outdoorsman at heart and I ride my bike to work every day, go on as many hikes as possible and launch my mountain bike off jumps with reckless abandon. I am slowly working my way through [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) and the related exercises. I am looking for a reason to use [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) on a project (seriously, if you have a project in mind, contact me!).

Recent projects I have worked on:

- Building an Angular 6 app with a .NET Core back-end for a large health insurance provider.
- Contributing [this Angular library](https://github.com/DeanPDX/angular-validation-summary) to the NPM.
- Schlepping HTML and CSS for [Neutrogena](https://www.neutrogena.com/).
- Building a load-balanced, stateless payment processing portal for a Fortune 100 company that integrates with Chase Orbital Gateway.
- Building a user interface for a research lab project for a Fortune 100 chip manufacturer.

Older projects I have worked on:

- Building ASP.Net Web APIs with AngularJS SPAs as the front-end and deploying to Azure.
- Building ASP.Net MVC apps with the Razor view engine.
- Building a PlayStation Mobile app as a side-project and having it ready to launch the day Sony announced they are deprecating PSM.
- Spending over 5 years of my life working on a monolithic WPF app. #NeverAgain
