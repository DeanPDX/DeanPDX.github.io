# SPC Meeting 6/8/2015

Notes from SPC/LPC meeting.

## ECS LIVA
There was an interesting low-powered device there called the ECS LIVA (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856501007).  For sure on the higher power-consuming side of the spectrum compared to a lot of the other devices in question but really cool and supports gigabit ethernet.

## KiCad
One guy brought a PCB that he designed and then had printed.  It was pretty dang cool.  He designed it using KiCad (http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite) and printed it via OSH Park (https://oshpark.com/) which was borne out of DorkbotPDX.  You can even have custom text (a website, etc.) printed on to your PCB.  He had his personal website printed on the board he designed.

## Voltera
There was a kickstarter that I never heard about called Voltera: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltera/voltera-your-circuit-board-prototyping-machine.  Basically a printer for circuit boards.  They have some special solder compound that is their "secret sauce".  Jokes about the printer being free but having to pay for the toner abounded.

## SJ Cam
The organizer of the event brought an interesting wifi camera that he bought (a GoPro ripoff) because it's running Linux and has wifi and allows you to access it via terminal as root (http://www.sjcam.com/cameras/27-sjcam-sj4000-wifi-1080p-full-hd-action-camera-sport-dvr.html).  Several people remoted in to it to check it out including a Debian developer who was there using a handheld Linux terminal.
